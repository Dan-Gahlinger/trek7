DEC 2008 - ALL code released folks! it RUNS! whoo!

Linux and VMS versions released with source and binaries, it works!!
VMS has multiplayer and Linux is only single player for now....


older notes:

I've temporarily misplaced the data files, they'll be up soon.
most of this code is depricated old fortran from the early 70s
and doesnt even port to compaq fortran properly (I know, I've tried).
f2c is almost a wash, but I do have some preliminary c conversions
which I will post when I find them.

a lot of code clean up needs to be done, some routines have to be
totally rewritten (maybe all). But I want the basic logic to stay the same.
the feel of the game must remain.
